# Angularios
Sandbox for raising sand in AngularJS

## Intro
This another of my foo-ios projects (e.g. nodeio, utilios) for keeping a record of
basic explorations, sanity checks, and other curiosties. In this case the `foo` is
`AngularJS`.

## Testing
`mocha` which will find the test suites in the place it normally looks: `test/`
